Yes, exactly! The `@Bean` and `@Autowired` annotations can be seen as complementary in the Spring framework.

- **`@Bean`** is used to define **how** a bean should be created in the Spring container. Itâ€™s typically used in a configuration class to explicitly create and register a bean.

- **`@Autowired`** is used to tell Spring **where** the bean should be injected. It allows Spring to automatically provide the dependency by injecting the appropriate bean wherever it's needed.

### How they work together:
- You use `@Bean` to define the beans (like `MyServiceImpl`) that Spring should manage.
- You use `@Autowired` to let Spring know where to inject those beans into other components, like `MyController`.

For example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}

@Component
public class MyController {

    private MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public void performAction() {
        myService.execute();
    }
}
```

Here:
- `@Bean` creates and registers the `MyService` bean.
- `@Autowired` automatically injects that `MyService` bean into the `MyController` class.

In short, `@Bean` is responsible for defining beans, and `@Autowired` is responsible for injecting those beans where they're needed. They work together to help you manage dependencies in a Spring application.
